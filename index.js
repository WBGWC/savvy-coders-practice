 //Concatenation and coercion

// keep track of the total

// HW 3 Solution******** HIGHLY IMPORTANT

/*Create an object literal. This object literal could be named numberSummerMachine .
*numberSummerMachine should have ðŸ”‘s for startingNumber and endingNumber . numberSummerMachine *should have a method - perhaps called sumDaNumbers . This method should use the current value of *its startingNumber and endingNumber and it should use looping (either while or for ) to return the *'sum of the numbers.'
*
*Note that `startingNumber` and `endingNumber` can be set as whatever values you want, but it's *just done 'manually.'

*HINT: You will need to use this inside of the function to access the properly scoped ðŸ”‘s.
